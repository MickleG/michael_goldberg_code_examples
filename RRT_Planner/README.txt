This is an RRT planner I made for a simplified version of the UR5 robotic arm for my robotics class. It uses the first three links, and attempts to get from the start node (blue) to the goal node (red). This uses pybullet as the physics environment, and I loaded to ur5 urdf into this environment. Simply run it by running the rrt_planner.py script. THe collision_utils.py script was not made by me, that was provided to us by our instructor due to the 3D collision checking not being covered in the course yet.
